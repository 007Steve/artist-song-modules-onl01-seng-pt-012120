# Artists and Songs

This lab is all about sharing behavior between classes using modules. It also includes a logical bug that's represented by a failing test.

Already provided is the non-DRY version of the artist and song classes. These classes are similar to those that you saw in the playlister domain.

1. Bug about infinite loop in assigning an artist to a sogn
2. findable
3. memorable
4. paramable
